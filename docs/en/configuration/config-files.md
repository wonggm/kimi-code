# Configuration files

Kimi Code CLI writes all long-term preferences into TOML (plain-text configuration) files under `~/.kimi-code/`: runtime settings live in `config.toml`, and terminal-UI preferences live in a companion `tui.toml`.

## Config file location

The CLI reads configuration from `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, created automatically on first run. To relocate the data directory, override it with the `KIMI_CODE_HOME` environment variable:

```sh
export KIMI_CODE_HOME=/path/to/kimi-home
```

The config file path then becomes `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/config.toml`. Regardless of where the directory lives, the file name is always `config.toml`.

::: tip
TOML field names always use snake_case, for example `default_model` and `max_context_size`. If a key contains `.`, you must quote it (for example `[models."gpt-4.1"]`); otherwise TOML treats `.` as a nested table separator.

## Complete example

The following example covers the most commonly used configuration fields. You can copy it and adjust as needed:

```toml
default_model = "kimi-code/k3"
default_permission_mode = "manual"
default_plan_mode = false
merge_all_available_skills = true
telemetry = true

[providers."managed:kimi-code"]
type = "kimi"
base_url = "https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1"
api_key = ""

[models."kimi-code/k3"]
provider = "managed:kimi-code"
model = "k3"
max_context_size = 1048576
capabilities = [ "thinking", "always_thinking", "image_in", "video_in", "tool_use" ]
display_name = "K3"
support_efforts = [ "low", "high", "max" ]
default_effort = "max"

[models."kimi-code/kimi-for-coding"]
provider = "managed:kimi-code"
model = "kimi-for-coding"
max_context_size = 262144
capabilities = [ "thinking", "always_thinking", "image_in", "video_in", "tool_use" ]

[models."kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed"]
provider = "managed:kimi-code"
model = "kimi-for-coding-highspeed"
max_context_size = 262144
capabilities = [ "thinking", "always_thinking", "image_in", "video_in", "tool_use" ]

[thinking]
enabled = true
effort = "high"
keep = "all"

[loop_control]
max_attempts_per_step = 10
reserved_context_size = 50000

[background]
max_running_tasks = 4
keep_alive_on_exit = false

[services.moonshot_search]
base_url = "https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/search"
api_key = ""

[services.moonshot_fetch]
base_url = "https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/fetch"
api_key = ""

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "deny"

```

## Top-level fields

Fields in the config file fall into two categories: **top-level scalars** that directly control default behavior, and **nested tables** (`providers`, `models`, `thinking`, etc.) that each have their own structure, described individually in the sections below.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default_model` | `string` | — | Default model alias; must be defined in `models` |
| `default_permission_mode` | `string` | `manual` | Default permission mode for new sessions: `manual`, `yolo`, or `auto`. See [the three permission modes](../guides/interaction.md#the-three-permission-modes) |
| `default_plan_mode` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether new sessions start in [Plan mode](../guides/interaction.md#plan-mode) by default |
| `merge_all_available_skills` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to merge Agent Skills from all available directories |
| `extra_skill_dirs` | `array<string>` | — | Extra skill search directories, layered on top of the default directories |
| `extra_agent_dirs` | `array<string>` | — | Extra custom agent search directories, layered on top of the default directories |
| `builtin_product_skills` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether the built-in skills that document Kimi Code itself are offered to the model |
| `telemetry` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether anonymous telemetry is enabled; disabled only when explicitly set to `false` |
| [`providers`](#providers) | `table` | `{}` | API provider table |
| [`models`](#models) | `table` | — | Model alias table |
| [`thinking`](#thinking) | `table` | — | Default parameters for Thinking mode |
| [`loop_control`](#loop_control) | `table` | — | Agent loop control parameters |
| [`background`](#background) | `table` | — | Background task runtime parameters |
| [`tools`](#tools) | `table` | — | Global tool switch |
| [`image`](#image) | `table` | — | Image compression parameters |
| [`services`](#services) | `table` | — | Built-in external service configuration |
| [`permission`](#permission) | `table` | — | Initial permission rules |
| [`hooks`](../customization/hooks.md) | `array<table>` | — | Lifecycle hooks |
| [`identity`](#identity) | `table` | — | Custom agent identity |

## `providers`

Each entry in the `providers` table defines an API provider, keyed by a unique name. The CLI reads credentials only from here. It does **not** fall back to shell environment variables automatically: running `export KIMI_API_KEY` in the terminal does not give any provider its key; you must write it explicitly in the config file (see [Config overrides](./overrides.md#provider-credentials)).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | Yes | Provider type: `kimi`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `openai_responses`, `google-genai`, `vertexai` |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | API key, written in plain text in the config file |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | API base URL |
| `oauth` | `table` | No | OAuth credential reference (`storage` and `key` fields); injected automatically by the login flow, so you normally never write this by hand |
| `env` | `table<string, string>` | No | Fallback source for provider credentials; see the `env` sub-table |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each request |

**`env` sub-table**: You can write provider-conventional key names (such as `KIMI_API_KEY`) inside `[providers.<name>.env]` as a fallback source for `api_key` / `base_url`. This sub-table is **read only from the config file** and does not modify the shell environment:

```toml
[providers.kimi.env]
KIMI_API_KEY = "sk-xxx"
KIMI_BASE_URL = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1"
```

Priority: `api_key` field > `env` sub-table key > if both are absent, startup fails with an error.

## `models`

Each entry in the `models` table defines a model alias (the name used in `default_model` or the `-m` flag), keyed by a unique name.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | `string` | Yes | Name of the provider to use; must be defined in `providers` |
| `model` | `string` | Yes | Model identifier sent to the server when calling the API |
| `max_context_size` | `integer` | Yes | Maximum context length in tokens; must be at least 1 |
| `max_input_size` | `integer` | No | Declared per-request input limit; compaction, context-overflow checks, and usage ratios prefer it, completion budgeting keeps the total window |
| `max_output_size` | `integer` | No | Per-request output token cap (maps to `max_tokens`); currently only the `anthropic` provider reads it |
| `capabilities` | `array<string>` | No | Capability tags added explicitly: `thinking`, `always_thinking`, `image_in`, `video_in`, `audio_in`, `tool_use`, `dynamically_loaded_tools`; only ever added, never removed |
| `support_efforts` | `array<string>` | No | Thinking effort levels the model accepts; unsupported values fall back to `default_effort`, out-of-list values fail; managed refreshes may rewrite it (pin via overrides) |
| `default_effort` | `string` | No | Default thinking effort for the model; managed and open-platform refreshes may rewrite it. Pin via [model overrides](#model-overrides) |
| `off_effort` | `string` | No | Effort value sent on the wire to disable thinking (e.g. `none` for xai grok); the only way to actually stop reasoning on models that reason by default |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | Per-model endpoint override (written by catalog imports); takes precedence over the provider's `base_url`, only effective together with `protocol` |
| `display_name` | `string` | No | Name shown in the UI; falls back to `model` when unset |
| `reasoning_key` | `string` | No | `openai` provider only; set when the gateway returns reasoning content under a non-standard field name (`reasoning_content` and friends are auto-detected) |
| `adaptive_thinking` | `boolean` | No | `anthropic` provider only; force adaptive thinking on or off, omit to infer from the model name (Claude ≥ 4.6 uses adaptive) |

When an alias contains `.`, use a quoted key:

```toml
[models."gpt-4.1"]
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4.1"
max_context_size = 1047576
```

### Model overrides

Use `[models."<alias>".overrides]` for user overrides that must survive provider-model refreshes. Runtime consumers read the effective value: the override when present, otherwise the top-level field.

```toml
[models."kimi-code/kimi-for-coding"]
provider = "managed:kimi-code"
model = "kimi-for-coding"
max_context_size = 262144

[models."kimi-code/kimi-for-coding".overrides]
max_context_size = 131072
display_name = "Kimi for Coding (custom)"
```

`[models."<alias>".overrides]` accepts ordinary model fields such as `max_context_size`, `max_input_size`, `max_output_size`, `capabilities`, `display_name`, `reasoning_key`, `adaptive_thinking`, `support_efforts`, `default_effort`, and `off_effort`. It does not accept identity / routing fields: `provider`, `model`, `protocol`, `beta_api`, and `base_url`.

You can also switch models temporarily without touching the config file: setting `KIMI_MODEL_*` environment variables synthesizes a temporary provider in memory that does not persist after restart. See [Define a model from environment variables](./env-vars.md#define-a-model-from-environment-variables-kimi_model_).

## `secondary_model`

Subagents inherit the model the main agent is running by default. The `[secondary_model]` section makes this configurable: it offers subagents a pool of candidate models plus a default binding. Typically that is a cheaper model for subtasks that do not need the main model's capability.

### Subagent model pool

The pool is always available and needs no opt-in; with no `[secondary_model]` keys configured, subagents simply inherit the caller's model.

The minimal configuration is one line. A lone `default_model` is a pool with a single entry:

```toml
[secondary_model]
default_model = "kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default_model` | `string` | — | The default model for subagents |
| `models` | `table<string, string>` | — | Subagent model pool; each key is the alias of a configured [`[models]`](#models) entry, each value a selection hint |
| `force` | `boolean` | `false` | Pin every subagent to `default_model`, taking the choice away from the main agent |
| `default_effort` | `string` | — | The thinking effort every spawned subagent binds with; outranks the bound model entry's own `default_effort` |

Constraints between the fields:

- `default_model`: required when a `models` table is configured, and must be one of its keys.
- `models`: values may be Chinese or English; an empty string lists the alias with no hint.
- `force`: requires `default_model` and cannot be combined with a `models` table: the table exists to offer a choice, and force removes it.
- `default_effort` is section-wide: every spawn binds it regardless of the chosen pool entry (or the forced model). For per-entry efforts, leave it unset and use model variants (see below).
- `primary` is a reserved alias (see below) and cannot be a pool key.

Pool aliases reference the current `[models]` table: if a provider is later deleted or logged out, or its refreshed model list no longer contains an alias, session startup fails with a configuration error naming the broken alias. Fix or remove the entry to recover. The `[secondary_model]` section itself is never rewritten automatically.

In the interactive TUI, the [`/secondary-model`](../reference/slash-commands.md) command (alias `/subagent-model`) opens a model selector: the choice is written to `default_model` (when a models table exists and the picked alias is not in it, an entry with an empty description is added), and newly spawned subagents pick up the new default immediately, no session restart needed.

A configured pool (an explicit `models` table or a lone `default_model`) enables model selection: the `Agent` / `AgentSwarm` tools gain a `model` parameter, and the tool description lists the pool (the default marked `[default]`) so the main agent can choose per spawn. Pool keys can only reference configured [`[models]`](#models) entries. The `kimi-code/*` aliases below are provisioned by `/login`:

```toml
[secondary_model]
default_model = "kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed"
[secondary_model.models]
"kimi-code/k3" = "Pick this for hard problems. Strong at complex reasoning, algorithm design, deep debugging, math, and systematic challenges."
"kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed" = "Fast but priced higher. Good for latency-sensitive tasks: daily refactoring, code explanation, small edits, and summaries."
"kimi-code/kimi-for-coding" = "A balanced coding workhorse. Good for most feature development and code-change tasks."
```

A spawn resolves the subagent's model in this order:

1. An explicit `model` passed in the tool call
2. `default_model`

Rules for the `model` parameter:

- It accepts any pool alias, or `"primary"`, the model the caller itself is running; always valid even when not in the pool.
- When neither `default_model` nor `models` is configured, the parameter is not advertised and subagents inherit the caller's model.
- Binding a pool alias does not inherit the caller's thinking effort. The section's `default_effort` wins when set. Otherwise, `[thinking].enabled = false` keeps Thinking off; when Thinking is enabled, resolution continues with the bound model entry's `default_effort`, the global `[thinking].effort`, then the middle of the bound model's `support_efforts`.
- `"primary"` inherits both the model and the effort level from the caller.
- A value that is neither a pool alias nor `"primary"` fails the spawn with an error listing the available choices.

To take the choice away from the main agent and run every subagent on one fixed model, add `force = true`:

```toml
[secondary_model]
default_model = "kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed"
force = true
```

With `force` set, the `model` parameter is not advertised (just like when nothing is configured) and every spawn binds `default_model`; an explicit `model` argument, `"primary"` included, is rejected with an error.

### Different thinking efforts per pool entry

Binding a pool alias lands the subagent on the bound model's default effort. You can exploit this by registering a "variant" entry for the same underlying model, so the main agent picks the thinking level together with the alias:

1. Register a second entry for the same underlying model in [`[models]`](#models), overriding only `default_effort` via [`[models."<alias>".overrides]`](#model-overrides).
2. List both the original alias and the variant alias in the pool.

```toml
# "kimi-code/k3" is provisioned by /login (default: high); this registers
# a max-effort variant of the same model
[models.k3-max]
provider = "managed:kimi-code"
model = "k3"
max_context_size = 1048576
capabilities = [ "thinking", "always_thinking", "image_in", "video_in", "tool_use" ]
support_efforts = [ "low", "high", "max" ]

[models.k3-max.overrides]
default_effort = "max"

[secondary_model]
default_model = "kimi-code/k3"
[secondary_model.models]
"kimi-code/k3" = "Default high effort. Good for most implementation, analysis, and multi-turn interaction tasks."
k3-max = "The same model at max thinking effort. Good for the hardest subtasks."
```

Two prerequisites:

- The underlying model must declare `support_efforts` (under `managed:kimi-code` only the k3 family currently declares effort levels).
- The variant is a standalone entry and does not inherit fields from the entry it points at: copy `capabilities`, `support_efforts`, and the other metadata over in full, otherwise `default_effort` has no effect (it must be a member of `support_efforts`).

Note the asymmetry between the main agent and pool-bound subagents: for the main agent, a configured global `[thinking].effort` overrides the variant's `default_effort`; for subagents the variant's `default_effort` wins over the global value, and only `[secondary_model].default_effort` outranks it. Value and fallback rules follow the [`[models]` entry's `default_effort`](#models).

::: warning Note
Configuration errors fail loudly instead of falling back silently. Session creation, resume, and fork all fail at startup when:

- `default_model` is missing, is not a pool key, or a pool key does not resolve to a configured [`[models]`](#models) entry;
- `force` is set without `default_model`, or combined with a `models` table.
:::

## `thinking`

`thinking` sets the global default behavior for Thinking mode.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether Thinking is enabled by default for new sessions; set to `false` to force Thinking off |
| `effort` | `string` | — | Thinking effort: `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`; falls back to the model default when not in its supported list |
| `keep` | `string` | `"all"` | Preserved Thinking passthrough: `kimi` sends it as `thinking.keep`, `anthropic` as a `clear_thinking_20251015` edit (routes to the beta Messages API). An off-value disables it; overridden by `KIMI_MODEL_THINKING_KEEP`; injected only while Thinking is on |

<details><summary>Deprecated fields</summary>

| Field | Deprecated in | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default_thinking` | 0.21.0 | Top-level boolean, replaced by `[thinking] enabled`. Migrate `default_thinking = true` to `enabled = true`, and `default_thinking = false` to `enabled = false`. |
| `thinking.mode` | 0.21.0 | One of `auto` / `on` / `off`, replaced by `[thinking] enabled`. `mode = "off"` becomes `enabled = false`; `mode = "on"` and `mode = "auto"` are equivalent to `enabled = true` (the default) and can be removed. |
| `loop_control.max_retries_per_step` | 0.32.0 | Replaced by `loop_control.max_attempts_per_step` (the value was always a total-attempt limit, including the first try). The old key is ignored and reports a warning on startup; rename it in `config.toml`. |
| `loop_control.max_steps_per_run` | 0.32.0 | Replaced by `loop_control.max_steps_per_turn`. The old key is ignored and reports a warning on startup; rename it in `config.toml`. |

</details>

## `loop_control`

`loop_control` governs the step count limit, the per-step attempt limit, and the thresholds and attempt limit for automatic context compaction in the Agent execution loop.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_steps_per_turn` | `integer` | — | Maximum steps per turn; unset or `0` means unlimited |
| `max_attempts_per_step` | `integer` | `10` | Maximum total attempts for a failing step, including the initial attempt |
| `reserved_context_size` | `integer` | — | Number of tokens reserved for model output; automatic compaction is triggered when the remaining context window falls below this value |
| `compaction_max_attempts` | `integer` | `5` | Maximum total attempts for a failing compaction request, including the initial attempt |
| `compaction_trigger_ratio` | `number` | `0.85` | Share of the model's context window (0.5–0.99) at which automatic compaction triggers; also adjustable in the web UI under Settings → Agent |

`max_steps_per_turn` can be overridden by the `KIMI_LOOP_MAX_STEPS_PER_TURN` environment variable, and `max_attempts_per_step` by `KIMI_LOOP_MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_STEP`; both take higher priority than the config file. The former `KIMI_LOOP_MAX_RETRIES_PER_STEP` variable is deprecated but still honored (with a startup warning) when the new one is unset.

Retries only apply to transient failures: connection errors, timeouts, HTTP 429 rate limits, and 5xx server errors. A 429 caused by an exhausted quota or insufficient account balance is not retried and fails immediately, since it cannot succeed until the account is recharged.

## `token_counting`

`token_counting` selects which context token count is reported externally, the value behind the context-size display. Internal logic (automatic compaction triggers, budgets, and overflow backoff) always uses both provider-reported usage and estimates, regardless of this setting.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `"measured+estimated" \| "measured" \| "estimated"` | `"measured+estimated"` | `measured+estimated` combines measured usage with an estimate of the unmeasured tail; `measured` reports provider usage alone, updated when a request completes; `estimated` is a pure estimate, for providers that do not report usage |

`strategy` can be overridden by the `KIMI_TOKEN_COUNTING_STRATEGY` environment variable, which takes higher priority than `config.toml`.

## `background`

`background` controls the concurrency behavior of background tasks (launched via the `Bash` tool or the `Agent` tool's `run_in_background=true` parameter).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_running_tasks` | `integer` | — | Maximum number of background tasks running concurrently |
| `keep_alive_on_exit` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to keep still-running background tasks when the session closes; in print mode only a fallback when `print_background_mode` is unset (`true` = `drain`) |
| `kill_grace_period_ms` | `integer` | `5000` | Grace period in milliseconds after a task is asked to terminate; still-running tasks are force-stopped when it elapses |
| `bash_auto_background_on_timeout` | `boolean` | `true` | Move a foreground `Bash` command to a background task on timeout instead of killing it; set to `false` to kill timed-out foreground commands instead |
| `bash_task_timeout_s` | `integer` | `600` | Default timeout (seconds) for background `Bash` tasks when the call omits `timeout`; `0` means no timeout. Explicit per-call `timeout` values are unaffected; print mode defaults to `0` |
| `print_background_mode` | `"exit" \| "drain" \| "steer"` | `"steer"` | Print mode only: how pending background tasks are handled when the main agent's turn ends; `"exit"` exits immediately, `"drain"` waits for terminal states without feeding results back, `"steer"` injects completions as synthetic user messages steering new turns until none are pending |
| `print_wait_ceiling_s` | `integer` | `2147483` | Wall-clock ceiling (seconds) for the print-mode wait/steer loop; no effect outside print mode or with `"exit"` |
| `print_max_turns` | `integer` | `100000` | Maximum number of new turns triggered by background-task completions in `"steer"` mode; keeps the steering loop bounded |

`keep_alive_on_exit` can be overridden by the `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_KEEP_ALIVE_ON_EXIT` environment variable, `max_running_tasks` by `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_MAX_RUNNING_TASKS`, `bash_task_timeout_s` by `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_BASH_TASK_TIMEOUT_S`, and `print_background_mode`, `print_wait_ceiling_s`, and `print_max_turns` by `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_PRINT_BACKGROUND_MODE`, `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_PRINT_WAIT_CEILING_S`, and `KIMI_CODE_BACKGROUND_PRINT_MAX_TURNS`; all take higher priority than `config.toml`.

In print mode (`kimi -p "<prompt>"`), Kimi Code stays alive after the main agent's turn as long as background tasks are still pending: each completion is fed back to the main agent as a synthetic user message, steering it into a new turn (`print_background_mode = "steer"` by default), and the run exits once a turn ends with nothing pending. The loop is bounded by `print_wait_ceiling_s` and `print_max_turns`, both effectively unbounded by default. Background work is never killed by a wall-clock cap in print mode either: background `Bash` tasks default to no timeout (`bash_task_timeout_s = 0`), and subagents run without a timeout (`[subagent] timeout_ms` and `[swarm] timeout_ms` both default to `0` unless explicitly set), so only the model itself stops a task. Set `print_background_mode` to `"drain"` to wait for tasks without feeding results back, or `"exit"` to end the run as soon as the main agent finishes.

## `subagent`

`subagent` controls how subagents spawned by the `Agent` tool run.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout_ms` | `integer` | `7200000` (2 hours) | Maximum wall-clock time (milliseconds) a single `Agent` subagent may run before it is settled as `timed_out`; `0` means no timeout |

`timeout_ms` can be overridden by the `KIMI_SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable, which takes higher priority than `config.toml`.

## `swarm`

`swarm` controls how subagents launched by the `AgentSwarm` tool run, independently of `[subagent]`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout_ms` | `integer` | `7200000` (2 hours) | Maximum wall-clock time (milliseconds) a single `AgentSwarm` subagent may run; on timeout it is aborted and the aggregated report marks `Subagent timed out.`; `0` means no timeout |

`timeout_ms` can be overridden by the `KIMI_CODE_SWARM_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable, which takes higher priority than `config.toml`.

## `mcp`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `startup_timeout_ms` | `integer` | `30000` (30 seconds) | Global default connection (startup + tool discovery) timeout in milliseconds for all MCP servers; a per-server `startupTimeoutMs` in `mcp.json` wins |
| `tool_timeout_ms` | `integer` | `60000` (60 seconds) | Global default single tool-call timeout in milliseconds for all MCP servers; a per-server `toolTimeoutMs` in `mcp.json` wins |

`startup_timeout_ms` and `tool_timeout_ms` can be overridden by the `KIMI_MCP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` and `KIMI_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variables respectively, which take higher priority than `config.toml`. See [MCP](../customization/mcp.md) for the full MCP server configuration.

## `identity`

Customizes how the agent identifies itself. Leave it unset and nothing changes.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | — | Display name the agent calls itself in the system prompt (fills the `${product_name}` slot, including in your own `SYSTEM.md` and agent files) |
| `slug` | `string` | derived from `name` | Machine identifier in protocol fields (`User-Agent` product token, MCP client name); derived from `name` when omitted: lowercased, non-alphanumeric runs folded to `-` |

```toml
[identity]
name = "Acme Dev Agent"
slug = "acme-dev"        # optional
```

Both fields can be set through the `KIMI_CODE_IDENTITY_NAME` and `KIMI_CODE_IDENTITY_SLUG` environment variables, which take higher priority than `config.toml` and are never written back to it, making them convenient for containers and CI, where writing a config file is awkward.

A name that contains no ASCII letters or digits (for example a purely Chinese name) leaves nothing to derive a slug from and falls back to `agent`; write `slug` explicitly if you need a specific protocol token.

The identity is resolved once at startup and holds for the life of the process: it is announced to MCP servers and providers when connections are made, so it cannot change midway. Edits to this section take effect on the next start, for new sessions: a resumed session keeps the system prompt it was recorded with, since its past turns already speak under that identity. Likewise, an MCP OAuth authorization keeps the client registration it was granted under; reset that server's authentication to register under the new identity.

This section is read by the `agent-core-v2` engine, which powers every Kimi Code surface.

## `subagent_models`

`subagent_models` pins a model alias per subagent type, so e.g. read-only exploration can run on a cheaper model while the main session uses a different one. Keys are subagent profile names (`coder`, `explore`, `plan`); values are model aliases as defined in `[models."<alias>"]`.

```toml
[subagent_models]
explore = "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"
plan = "deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro"
```

A subagent type not listed here inherits the model of the agent that spawned it (the previous behavior for all subagents). Applies to both `Agent` and `AgentSwarm` spawns, and to resumed subagents.

## `tools`

`tools` is the global tool switch: it applies to every agent in all sessions and intersects with each agent's own `tools` / `disallowedTools` policy.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `array<string>` | — | Global allowlist: when non-empty, only the listed tools are available; omitting the field or setting an empty array imposes no constraint |
| `disabled` | `array<string>` | — | Global denylist, applied after `enabled` |

Name matching follows the same rules as the same-named fields in an agent file: built-in tools match by exact name (such as `Read`), and MCP tools match with globs (such as `mcp__github__*`). Three entry shapes never match anything and are reported with a warning: a wildcard outside an `mcp__` pattern (`enabled = ["*"]` disables every tool, `disabled = ["*"]` disables none), an `mcp__` literal missing the tool segment (`mcp__github`; use `mcp__github__*` for a whole server), and a name no registered or built-in tool has (matching is case-sensitive).

```toml
[tools]
disabled = ["EnterPlanMode", "ExitPlanMode", "mcp__github__*"]
```

::: warning Note
Like the `tools` / `disallowedTools` fields of an agent file, this section shapes the tools shown to the model and is enforced again before execution. [Permission rules](#permission) remain a separate control for operations that require approval.
:::

## `read`

`read` controls the character limits for the [`Read` tool](../reference/tools.md). The limit includes file content, line numbers, and the status block; it does not impose a separate line-count or UTF-8 byte limit.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default_max_chars` | `integer` | `100000` | Character budget when the tool call omits `max_chars` |
| `max_chars` | `integer` | `500000` | Maximum character budget a tool call may request |

```toml
[read]
default_max_chars = 100000
max_chars = 500000
```

Both values must be positive integers. A call's `max_chars` overrides the default, but is capped at the configured maximum; the result reports the effective budget. If the configured default exceeds the maximum, the maximum also limits default reads. Raise `default_max_chars` when you want larger documents to be returned in one call without the agent requesting a larger budget.

## `image`

`image` controls how images are compressed before being sent to the model, across every ingestion point (pasted images, `ReadMediaFile` reads, images in MCP tool results, and so on).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_edge_px` | `integer` | `2000` | Longest-edge ceiling in pixels; larger images scale down proportionally. Raising it preserves more detail at the cost of larger request bodies |
| `read_byte_budget` | `integer` | `262144` (256 KB) | Per-image byte budget for images the model reads for itself (`ReadMediaFile` default reads); `region` and `full_resolution` read-backs are exempt |

`max_edge_px` can be overridden by the `KIMI_IMAGE_MAX_EDGE_PX` environment variable and `read_byte_budget` by `KIMI_IMAGE_READ_BYTE_BUDGET`; both take higher priority than `config.toml`.

## `database`

`database` controls the embedded storage engines behind session indexing and global search. Both keys default to `true` and act as kill switches that fall back to the legacy behavior when set to `false`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | `boolean` | `true` | Use the minidb-backed read model for session indexing; `false` falls back to reading session metadata directly |
| `search` | `boolean` | `true` | Run the global search index in a dedicated worker thread; `false` runs it in the server process |

`base` can be overridden by the `KIMI_CODE_PERSISTENCE_MINIDB_READMODEL` environment variable and `search` by `KIMI_CODE_SEARCH_WORKER`; both take higher priority than `config.toml`.

<!--
## `experimental`

`experimental` stores persistent overrides for experimental-feature flags. Currently, `micro_compaction` is the only user-facing entry and defaults to `false`; set it to `true` to enable automatic trimming of older large tool results.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `micro_compaction` | `boolean` | `false` | Trim older large tool results from context while preserving recent conversation |
-->

## `services`

`services` configures two built-in services: web search (`moonshot_search`) and web fetch (`moonshot_fetch`). Only these two fixed keys are recognized; other keys are ignored. Both entries share the same fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | `string` | No | Service API URL |
| `api_key` | `string` | No | API key |
| `oauth` | `table` | No | OAuth credential reference, same structure as `providers.*.oauth` |
| `custom_headers` | `table<string, string>` | No | Custom HTTP headers attached to each request |

`base_url` and `api_key` can also come from environment variables, which take priority over the config file: `KIMI_WEB_SEARCH_BASE_URL` / `KIMI_WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` for `moonshot_search`, and `KIMI_WEB_FETCH_BASE_URL` / `KIMI_WEB_FETCH_API_KEY` for `moonshot_fetch`. An env base URL defines a separate service endpoint, so the persisted API key, OAuth reference, and custom headers are not forwarded to it; set the matching env API key when that endpoint requires authentication. An env API key without an env base URL keeps the configured endpoint and custom headers but replaces both configured credential forms. Setting the base URL and API key through env without any config section also enables the service.

```toml
[services.moonshot_search]
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/search"
api_key = "sk-xxx"

[services.moonshot_fetch]
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/fetch"
api_key = "sk-xxx"
```

## `permission`

`permission` sets permission rules that are automatically loaded when a session starts, controlling whether the Agent needs user confirmation before calling a tool. Rules are written as a `[[permission.rules]]` array of tables, matched in order; the first matching rule takes effect.

You can also set `dangerous_command_guard = false` under `[permission]` to turn off the built-in dangerous-command policy entirely (no dangerous-command confirmation in Always Ask and Ask When Needed mode; the policy is never active in Never Ask mode); the default is `true`. An environment variable `KIMI_CODE_DANGEROUS_COMMAND_GUARD=false` overrides the file setting and restores the behavior before the policy was introduced. Use this switch only for environments that already gate commands outside the agent.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `decision` | `string` | Yes | Action on match: `allow` (permit immediately), `deny` (reject immediately), `ask` (prompt each time) |
| `scope` | `string` | No | Rule scope: `turn-override`, `session-runtime`, `project`, `user`; defaults to `user` |
| `pattern` | `string` | Yes | Match pattern in the form `ToolName` or `ToolName(arg-pattern)`, e.g. `Read` or `Bash(rm -rf*)` |
| `reason` | `string` | No | Rule description for debugging and auditing |

Built-in tool names are listed in [Built-in tools](../reference/tools.md). Most built-in tools that accept rule arguments define their own matching subject, such as `Bash(command-pattern)` or `Read(path-pattern)`. `AgentSwarm`, MCP tools, and custom tools can only be matched by tool name; argument patterns are not supported for them.

```toml
[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Read"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "allow"
pattern = "Grep"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "deny"
pattern = "Bash(rm -rf*)"

[[permission.rules]]
decision = "ask"
pattern = "Bash"
```

::: tip
MCP server declarations are configured in `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` or the project-local `.kimi-code/mcp.json`, not in `config.toml`. The interactive configuration entry point is `/mcp-config`; see [Model Context Protocol](../customization/mcp.md).
:::

## `tui.toml`

Alongside `config.toml`, the CLI keeps terminal-UI and client preferences in a companion `tui.toml` in the same directory (`~/.kimi-code/tui.toml`, or `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/tui.toml` when overridden). It is created with defaults on first run, and the interactive commands `/config`, `/theme`, and `/editor` write to it for you, so you rarely need to edit it by hand. If the file is malformed, the CLI falls back to defaults and shows a notice instead of failing to start.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `string` | `auto` | Color theme: `auto`, `dark`, `light`, or the name of a [custom theme](../customization/themes.md) |
| `render_latex` | `boolean` | `true` | Render LaTeX math expressions in Markdown messages as Unicode text; `false` keeps the raw source |
| `disable_paste_burst` | `boolean` | `false` | Disable the non-bracketed paste-burst fallback that keeps rapid multi-line pastes from submitting line by line |
| `cache_expiry_hint` | `boolean` | `true` | On resume or when submitting after a long idle stretch, warn that the context cache may have expired and offer to compact or start a new session (v2 engine only) |
| `disable_feedback_survey` | `boolean` | `false` | Disable the occasional session rating prompt above the input box |
| `[editor].command` | `string` | `""` | External editor command for composing long input; empty falls back to `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` |
| `[notifications].enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether desktop notifications are sent |
| `[notifications].notification_condition` | `string` | `unfocused` | When to notify: `unfocused` (only when the terminal is not focused) or `always` |
| `[upgrade].auto_install` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether new versions are installed automatically |
| `[status_line].items` | `string[]` | `[]` | Built-in slots on the first footer line and their order: `mode`, `goal`, `model`, `tasks`, `cwd`, `git`, `tips`; unknown ids are skipped with a warning |
| `[status_line].command` | `string` | `""` | Custom status line command: its first stdout line replaces the footer, and a JSON snapshot is passed on stdin; capped at 300ms, throttled to once per second, failures fall back to the built-in layout |

<details>
<summary>Fields in the stdin JSON snapshot</summary>

Model, cwd, git branch, permission mode, plan mode, context usage, session id, version.

</details>

```toml
# ~/.kimi-code/tui.toml
theme = "auto" # "auto" | "dark" | "light" | custom theme name
render_latex = true # false keeps LaTeX math in messages as raw source
disable_paste_burst = false # true disables non-bracketed paste-burst fallback
cache_expiry_hint = true # false disables the "cache expired" dialog on resume / idle submit
disable_feedback_survey = false # true hides the occasional session rating prompt

[editor]
command = "" # empty uses $VISUAL / $EDITOR

[notifications]
enabled = true
notification_condition = "unfocused" # "unfocused" | "always"

[upgrade]
auto_install = true

# [status_line]
# items = ["mode", "goal", "model", "tasks", "cwd", "git", "tips"]
# command = "~/.kimi-code/statusline.sh"
```

Changes apply on the next start, or immediately with `/reload-tui` (which reloads only `tui.toml`); `/reload` reloads both `config.toml` and `tui.toml`.

## Project-local configuration

In addition to the user-level files under `~/.kimi-code`, Kimi Code reads a project-local configuration file at `<project-root>/.kimi-code/local.toml`. It holds settings that are specific to one project checkout and typically should not be shared with teammates.

The file is created automatically when you add an extra workspace directory with [`/add-dir`](../reference/slash-commands.md) and choose to remember it for the project. You rarely need to edit it by hand.

### `[workspace]`

The `[workspace]` table groups project-level workspace settings:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `additional_dir` | `array<string>` | No | Additional workspace directories (absolute paths); written automatically when you confirm "remember this directory" in `/add-dir`, and available in every session of this project |

```toml
[workspace]
additional_dir = ["/absolute/path/to/shared"]
```

Because directories are stored as absolute paths, which are specific to your machine, we recommend adding `.kimi-code/local.toml` to your project's `.gitignore` so it is not committed.
